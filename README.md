# Swiss geo tweet - Affluence map and mobility patterns in Switzerland

## Abstract 

The aim of this project is to:
- build an affluence map of Switzerland based on various social network sources (geo-located tweets and possibly instagram posts at the moment)
- infer mobility patterns from it and try to detect from regular events (ex: people living in the Vaud canton but working in the Geneva canton) to major events (ex: Paleo Festival, Geneva auto showroom)

Using this timeline map, people will have the ability to get an affluence visualization other the time (months, days, hours) and space (main axes, cantons, cities, places). From there, they can filter the map and display the locations they can visit according if they want it crowded or not.

## Data Description

Our main source of data will be Twitter and Instagram posts.

There's already a dataset composed of tweets in Switzerland from 2012. The [Twitter API overview](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api) gives informations about what fields can be fetched from tweets
