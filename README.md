# Swiss geo tweet - Affluence map and mobility patterns in Switzerland

## Abstract 

The aim of this project is to:
- build an affluence map of Switzerland based on various social network sources (geo-located tweets and possibly instagram posts at the moment)
- infer mobility patterns from it and try to detect from regular events (ex: people living in the Vaud canton but working in the Geneva canton) to major events (ex: Paleo Festival, Geneva auto showroom)

Using this timeline map, people will have the ability to get an affluence visualization other the time (months, days, hours) and space (main axes, cantons, cities, places). From there, they can filter the map and display the locations they want to visit according if it's crowded or not at that time of the year/day.

## Data Description

Our main source of data will be Twitter and Instagram posts.

There's already a dataset composed of tweets in Switzerland from 2012. The [Twitter API overview](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api) gives informations about what fields can be fetched from tweets

We don't already have a dataset containing Instagram posts in Switzerland and it is part of our project to see if we can get this data. The [Instagram API endpoints](https://www.instagram.com/developer/endpoints/) gives informations about what can be fetched from Instagram posts.
We can use [Instagram API Location](https://www.instagram.com/developer/endpoints/locations/) to get either the posts coming from a certain location or the id that is given to a location.
